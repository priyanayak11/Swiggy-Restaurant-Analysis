📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes Swiggy restaurant data to uncover insights related to restaurant performance, customer preferences, delivery trends, and rating patterns.
Using Python along with data analysis and visualization libraries, the study highlights how various factors such as price, delivery time, location, and restaurant type influence customer ratings and food choices.
The goal of this project is to build strong exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
